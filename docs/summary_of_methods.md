# Choosing species to run ClustalOmega – 3 methods

## Method 1

BLAST the S. cerevisiae protein in Uniprot & choose every n-th species to download & use for the alignment (maybe every 10th? – for 20 or so sequences total?)
This is what you had a question in Discord about – I am hesitant to have you discard the entries that don’t have the original name, because sometimes the protein name changes between different species. For now, don’t discard any & choose every 10th one, for example, to do the alignment.

## Method 2

Look up the protein for all the fungal species below & use for alignment; Each can be searched directly in Uniprot and sequence downloaded

- Schizosaccharomyces pombe
- Scheffersomyces stipitis
- Ogataea parapolymorpha
- Komagataella phaffii
- Cyberlindnera fabianii
- Kluyveromyces lactis
- Vanderwaltozyma polyspora
- Zygosaccharomyces rouxii
- Saccharomyces paradoxus
- Candida glabrata
- Lachancea fermentati
- Ashbya gossypii
- Torulaspora delbruecki
- Kluyveromyces lactis
- Naumovozyma castellii
- Cyberlindnera jadinii
- Pachysolen tannophilus
- Candida auris

## Method 3

Look up the protein for the species below (from yeast to human) & use for alignment; Each can be searched directly in Uniprot and sequence downloaded, but you may run into issues if the protein name is not the same in higher organisms as it is in yeast

- Saccharomyces cerevisiae
- Drosophila melanogaster
- Danio reiro
- Xenopus laevus
- Gallus gallus
- Mus musculus
- Rattus norvegicus
- Homo sapiens
